# WebOS-LG-TV

This project represents a JavaScript application that runs on LG WebOS TV. The application downloads specific image and video media items, saves them to the local disk, and then sequentially displays them on the screen. After displaying the image and video, it loops back to the beginning.

The project includes:

- HTML and JavaScript files for running on the LG WebOS TV simulator
- JavaScript code that handles media downloading, saving, and displaying
- Configuration settings that require the usage of the LG WebOS TV SDK
- 
Note: To run the project, the LG WebOS TV SDK needs to be installed, and either a compatible simulator or a physical device needs to be used.
